# Baby_names_Visualization
Visualization 1 :
I have chosen as design a scatter plot displaying directly the different names with their size depending on the percentage of people with this name in a given year. 
Also we can by adjusting a slide bar, see the evolutoin of the popularity of a name throughout the years.  
This visualization answers indeed the question about the evolution of names. In fact, we can perceive independently the evoution of each name.
However a incovenient is that, we cannot access directly a specific name and locating some names is not that easy because of their sizes.



Visualization 2 :

I have plotted 3 charts for the 2nd visualization. The first one displays the most popular name for each region. Based on that, it is possible to identify some regional 
effects. We see for example that the name MICHEL is the most popular only in the region Orne as opposed to names like MARY which are quite well spreaded all over France. 
However, because this chart only display the most popular name by region, we cannot fully assess of the regional effect based solely on it since name like MICHEL 
for example can be the 2nd or 3rd most popular name in the neighbor regions of Orne. 

I have tried to adress part of this problem by alternating between the display of the 1st,2nd, 3rd and 4th most popular name. However this doesn not totally solves the 
stated problem. Also about the 2nd graph, the legend changes from one graph to another and a same name can be affected a different color depending on wether we are 
displaying the 2nd or the 3rd most popular name. I was not able to fix that. 

Finally I have plotted a 3rd chart which displayed the variation of popularity across France for a selection of name. Even if with this chart, we can fairly address 
the regional effect, the problem is that it is only for some preselected names. 

Visualization 3: 

The 3rd visulaization is pretty similar to the first one. Again the problem is that locating a specific name is complicated since the position were affected randomly. 
We have tried to solve this problem by affecting the position depending on the alphabetical order but the problem was that in the resulting chart the name were too much mashed up together.
